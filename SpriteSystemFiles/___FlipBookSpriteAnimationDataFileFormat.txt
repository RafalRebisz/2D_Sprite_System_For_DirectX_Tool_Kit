This file represents the "FlipBookSprite" animation settings file layout
witch needs to be followed in order to successfully load animation settings 


Rules:
1. first line in file should be a number of animations to be created
2. Separation lines can be left blank, however they must be present and CANNOT contain white spaces !!! or error will occur !!

NOTE:
one separation line must be present between number of animation value, and one line separating each animation data

3. strings don't need quotation marks
4. If animation is not looping to other animation "Id of animation to Loop To" must be defined as NONE
5. animation frame indexing starts at 0


file layout:

There are two ways of defining animation:

1. by range  (animation start frame - animation end frame)
  if your animation frames are in-line 
  for example animation starts at frame 0 and ends at frame 15
  use key word range, start frame and end frame.

2. by listing animation sequences manually
   if your animation is made from not in-line frames
   you can still build it manually by listing frame sequences in coma 
   separated style and terminate sequence by semicolon



Define animation by range:


1. Number of animations			- this is unsigned integer type
****Separation-Line****will-be-discarded****can-be-left-blank****
2. Animation ID					- this is string type
3. Id of animation to loop to	- this is string type, if animation is not looping to next animation than this need to be defined as NONE
4. Animation speed				- this is float type 1.0 is one second
5. Range						- this key word tells the code that you specify animation frames in range
6. Animation start frame		- this is unsigned int type 
7. Animation end frame			- this is unsigned int type 



example how to define animations by "Range"

1
****Separation-Line****will-be-discarded****can-be-left-blank****
Running
NONE
1.0
Range
0
15

Notice the separation line following the animation definition, this line must be present even if only one animation is defined
you can define multiple animations there is no limit (theoretically) the number of animations must match with number of definitions

this shows how to define 2 animations:


2
**** Separation Line **** will be discarded **** can be left blank****
Jump
Idle
1.0
Range
16
25
**** Separation Line **** will be discarded **** can be left blank****
Idle
NONE
1.0
Range
25
40


Define animation by listing sequence of frames:


1. Number of animations			- this is unsigned integer type
****Separation-Line****will-be-discarded****can-be-left-blank****
2.  Animation ID				- this is string type
3. Id of animation to loop to	- this is string type, if animation is not looping to next animation than this need to be defined as NONE
4. Animation speed				- this is float type 1.0 is one second
5. Sequence						- this key word tells the code you will supply sequence of animation frames manually 
6. 1,5,7,8,5,56;				- sequence of animation frames starts at this line number of frames is 256, new lines are not allowed,
								  values must be separated by comma and sequence must be terminated by semicolon, 


example how to define animations by "Sequence" it's nearly the same as by "Range"


1
****Separation-Line****will-be-discarded****can-be-left-blank****
Running
NONE
1.0
Sequence
1,3,5,23,14,15,5,3,8,3,1,2,3;


Again !!!

Notice the separation line following the animation definition this line must be present even if only one animation is defined
you can define multiple animations there is no limit (theoretically) the number of animations must match with number of defined animations

this shows how to define 2 animations:

2
****Separation-Line****will-be-discarded****can-be-left-blank****
Jump
Idle
1.0
Sequence
1,3,5,23,14,15,5,3,8,3,1,2,3;
****Separation-Line****will-be-discarded****can-be-left-blank****
Idle
NONE
1.0
Sequence
1,3,15,5,3,8,3,1,,5,23,14,2,3;


Simple !!!


But that's not everything ! you can mix both ways of defining animations
lets define 8 animations
