This file represents the "TileSheetSprite"  tiles file layout

Rules:
1. first line in file should be a number of tiles to be created
2. Separation lines can be left blank, however they must be present and CANNOT contain white spaces !!! or error will occur !!!

NOTE:
one separation line must be present between number of tiles value, and one line separating each tile data

file layout:

first line of file is number of tiles definitions in file,
second line is the separation line this will be discarded, it can be left blank but must be present,
after separation line the tile data definition begins, tile data is defined as RECT structure and it is 
represented by four values left, right, top, bottom

left and right values are defined at first line, top and bottom values are defined at second line
values must be separated by blank space and the values must be also within the tile sheet sprite size


file layout example:

1. Number of tiles
****Separation-Line****will-be-discarded****can-be-left-blank****
2. RECT.left RECT.right
3. RECT.top RECT.bottom


To load 2 tiles you can simply do

2
****Separation-Line****will-be-discarded****can-be-left-blank****
0 100
0 100
****Separation-Line****will-be-discarded****can-be-left-blank****
200 250
200 250

you can also load multiple files by multiple calls to "LoadTilesFromFile(std::string fileName)"
tiles from separated files are concatenated to currently existing ones, to delete tiles you can call DeleteTiles(void)
